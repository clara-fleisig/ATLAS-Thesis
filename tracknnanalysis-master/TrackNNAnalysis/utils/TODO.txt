Plotting scripts should take constructed tracks as input
they should not have to re-run the tracking to make plots

plotTrack && plotTracksOverDetector should be combined into one script and operate on such input

processForPickleITK may or may not be necessary moving forward. We will need to save output tracks,
but they do not need to be formatted for pickling

Haider: I would like the logic for evalEtrapTree to be factorize out into a class not this utils
